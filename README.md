Python rewrite of the Hacklet tool.
=======

An Open Source client for the Modlet (smart) outlet

This rewrite is intended to be more for use as a monitoring tool, so long-running connections are the interest, rather then power control (which I frankly don't care about at all).

Functionality to push power-use numbers into emoncms will also likely be added.
