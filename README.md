Python rewrite of the Hacklet tool.
=======

An Open Source client for the Modlet (smart) outlet

This is a ground-up rewrite of the hacklet tool for use in long-running data-collection applications, rather then IFTTT triggered-action situations. It's also not written in the abomination that is ruby, and is considerably faster as well (at least juding by startup-first-data times on a raspberry pi)!
